## Introduction

A framework agnostic driver-based content rendering package, with support for HTML, Markdown & plain text.

You can register custom drivers for custom content types.

As you pass content to interpret, it will determine what it is and allow you to extract it's normal value and HTML equivalent.

The package requires PHP 5.3+ and comes bundled with a Laravel 4 and a Service Provider to simplify the optional framework integration and follows the FIG standard PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code and is fully unit-tested.
